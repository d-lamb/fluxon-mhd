This is the FLUX project directory.  

Subdirs are:
	tests -- specific applications that use the modules
	         (a little out of date perhaps)


        lib -- the central libflux.a core code

	doc -- design documents

	include -- 'c' header files 
	           (these get installed into /usr/local/include/flux/)
	
        pdl -- PDL glue code and perl module
