This is the FLUX top-level directory.

Subdirectories include:
	tests -- specific applications that use the modules
	         (a little out of date perhaps)


        lib -- the central libflux.a core simulation library

	doc -- some design documents

	include -- 'c' header files 
	           (these get installed into /usr/local/include/flux/)
	
        pdl -- PDL glue code and perl module
