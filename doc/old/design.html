<h2>Design notes for flr: a Field Line Relaxer in C</h2>
<i>Last update:11-Sep-2000</i>

<p>flr is designed as the "middle ground" in a total field line model.
It takes a field line description as input (there is a C interface to the
data structures themselves; or it can read stdin) and relaxes to the minimum
allowed energy state. 

<p>flr implements DeForest's simplex linear interpolation scheme for
energetic field line relaxation.

<a name="data"><h4>Data structures</h4>

<p>The boundary conditions are set by the location of physical magnetic
flux concentrations.  Notionally, flux concentrations are pointlike
objects in this model.  They are represented with a data structure
that is used to anchor the endpoints of field lines.  Free endpoints
(such as are on open field lines) are not attached to any flux
concentration, but tracked ones are.  A flux concentration holds a
tree of field lines which start on it, and a total amount of flux.
(This is redundant since the sum of the field lines' fluxes is the
same as the flux that belongs to the concentration, but there aren't
enough flux concentrations for the wastage to be a problem.)  The flux
concentration also contains a label, a location, and a size.

<p>The physical entities to be modeled are <b>field lines</b>.  A
field line is a structure that points off into a doubly-linked list of
vertices, and also has some ancillary information in the field line
itself: a vertex counter, a register to hold the total energy
associated with the field line, and some notation about the motion
rules for the boundary points, if any.  (For example, a semaphore is
needed to determine whether line endpoint is closed back to the other
endpoint, anchored to a boundary condition, or free).  The field lines
form a B-tree, indexed by field line label.

<p>Vertices contain links forward and backward, coordinates, and a list
of neighboring vertices on other field lines (or on this one).  In addition,
they contain some sort of pointer to the field line that owns them.  The 
pointer is needed to be able to recover the magnetic flux associated with the
line, without traversing all the way to the end of the fieldline.  On the
other hand, it feels like a wasteful use of space.  If it turns out you can
get by without it, for God's sake edit it out of the code!

<hr>

<a name="neighborhoods"><h4>Neighborhoods</h4>
<p>A crucial notion for this computation is that of <i>neighborhood</i> -- the
neighborhood of a line is the region into which its associated flux can 
notionally spread.  It is the locus that is closer to the line than to 
any other, and is important for the formalism.  I'm using "neighborhood" and 
not "Voronoi Cell", because the Voronoi cells of distributed objects are 
not simple to calculate, so a quicker-and-dirtier notion is used.

<p>The "neighborhood" of a field line, for the purposes of energetics
and forces, is the locus that is inside the planar Voronoi cell formed
by funky-projecting the field line and its nearest neighbors into the plane
perpendicular to the field line.  "Funky-projection" is chosen for
the simulation, but I'm starting with "projection of the point of closest
approach". 

<p>Funky-projection should have some (TBD) geometrical considerations added.

<p>There is a duality between tiepoints and line segments.  I use the two
terms interchangeably in the following discussion, using a tiepoint to refer
to the line segment that <i>follows</i> it along the field line. 
The difference matters in the discussion on forces (elsewhere in this document).

<p>In addition, <i>neighbors</i> are the tiepoints which are responsible
for forming the boundaries of a given tiepoint's neighborhood.  They are
``interesting'' from a bookkeeping standpoint:  keeping track of the neighbors
greatly reduces the computation required to find the neighborhood of each
point.  It removes a power of N from the computation's order.

<p>In particular, the 2-D neighborhood of each tiepoint is interesting 
because the tiepoints are what is moved during each timestep.  The basic
neighborhood-finding algorithm is as follows: 

<p><dl>
<dt><b>Compile a list of neighbor candidates</b>
<dd>The candidate neighbors are the former neighbors and <i>their</i>
neighbors.  no others need apply, so long as no point moves more than 
half of its neighborhood's width in any timestep.   The list should 
contain no duplicate <i>tiepoints</i>, though duplicate fieldlines
are allowed (it's conceivable for two different parts of a field line to
form different parts of a neighborhood's boundary).

<dt><b>Traverse the neighbor candidate fieldlines to the local point of
closest approach to the current tiepoint's field line segment.</b>
<dd>

<dt><b>Project the closest-approach points into the plane perpendicular to 
the current
fieldline at the current tiepoint</b>
<dd>The plane is perpendicular to the
sum of the directon vectors of the two field line segments at the
tiepoint.  This yields a list of candidate points in the local field
line perpendicular plane.  Duplicates should be eliminated at this stage --
if two candidate points are adjacent to the same tiepoint on a 
candidate neighboring line, then one should be eliminated.  The candidate
points should also get sorted into circular order.

<dt><b>Eliminate candidates until only true neighbors remain.</b>
<dd>A candidate is a neighbor only if its closest-approach point is inside
the angle formed by the adjacent candidates' bisector lines (see figure)
<b>(to do: make figure)</b>.

</dl>
<p>
The remaining set of points (or, more precisely, the tiepoints with which 
they are associated) are the new neighbor list.   The area of the 
locus is readily calculated by summing the areas of the individual triangles
formed by adjacent neighbors and the original point.

<p> By calculating the change in the area of each neighbor triangle,
it is possible to develop a formula for the ``force'' on the current
tiepoint, based on the distribution of its neighborhood. My original
idea was to minimize the energy numerically without reference to
force, but upon reflection (and after talking with Kankelborg about
his rather different method of doing this), it seems that this will
converge more quickly if the energy is differentiated analytically.


<hr>
<a name="algorithms"><h4>Required algorithms</h4>

<p>Some subsidiary algorithms are required.  Aside from the mechanical
ones of adding and substracting vertices from field lines, it's necessary
to be able to:

<p><dl>
<dt><b>Project neighboring vertices into the perpendicular plane</b>
<dd>This requires walking along the neighboring field line to find the
locally closest approach to the current field line, before projecting.
The projection should also take into account how far along the current
line the point of closest approach really is.

<p>

<hr>
<a name="model"><h4>Physical model</h4>

<p>
At the crux of the model is discovering a workable law for relaxing
the shapes of modeled field lines.  The usual half-cell offset between
locations at which derivatives are defined, and locations at which
spatial values are defined, holds here.  The forces on each field line
segment are notionally more or less centered on the line, while motion
happens at the tiepoints at either end of the line.  Forces (per unit
length) are calculated and assigned to each line segment,
tiepoint-wise; then the FPL's at each tiepoint are calculated by
averaging the two adjacent line segment forces. 

<hr>
<a name="io"><h4>File formats and I/O</h4>

<p>Flux concentraion locations are the fundamental input to the model. 
What is needed is a way to map flux concentration motion and evolution
as the model progresses.  The input to the fieldline model is a series of
input files that each contain a description of current flux concentration
location.  A flux concentration file has to be able not only to describe
a new map of concentrations, but also to describe how to change an old
map to fit a new map.

<p>Some file-wide information has to go at the top of the file.  Information
at the top of the file includes the timestep number and other stuff that is
TBD, in keyword/value format.

<p>Individual flux concentration descriptions are marked with
keywords.  Concentrations are labelled with numbers, so each line
begins with NEW, DELETE, MOVE, SPLIT, JOIN, EMERGE, or CANCEL.  NEW and
DELETE are there to set up the file, and act on individual flux
concentrations.  SPLIT/JOIN allow a single flux concentrations to split into
two concentrations that contain the same total flux, or for multiple
concentrations to merge into a single one.  EMERGE and CANCEL are special
cases of SPLIT and JOIN that act on emerging flux.  They allow spontaneous
generation and cancellation of pairs of flux concentrations.  All the
keywords are chosen to have different first letters, so that they may
be abbreviated :-).

<p>There should be another keyword for moving small bits of flux around, 
between flux concentrations.  This needs some thought.

<p>Some keywords exist to define fieldline linkages and vertices.  These
are primarily intended for save-and-restore functionality, so the whole
suite of motion type commands is not available -- only definition commands.
These keywords are "LINE" (to define a fieldline) and "VERTEX" (to define
a vertex within a particular field line).

<p>An additional keyword, FRAME, separates frames in the simulation.
For example, if the flux tracker is feeding data directly into the 
field line simulator, the FRAME keyword ells the simulator to stop and 
simulate the physics before updating the field again.

<p>Fields are whitespace delimited and variable-length, for ease of parsing
with sscanf().  Blank lines are ignored.

<p>Line formats:
<dl>

<p><dt><code><b>N[EW]</b> &lt;label&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;z&gt; &lt;flux&gt;</code>
<dd>Creates a new flux concentration out-of-the-blue (no connection map is
implied!)

<p><dt><code><b>D[ELETE]</b> &lt;label&gt;
<dd>Deletes the flux concentration &lt;label&gt; from the list.

<p><dt><code><b>M[OVE]</b> &lt;label&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;z&gt; [&lt;flux&gt;]
<dd>Moves the specified flux concentration to the specified location.
If the flux value is specified, then the flux is updated too.  It is
not clear what this means physically -- but it will need dealing with,
because magnetogram images do have noise.

<p><dt><code><b>S[PLIT]</b> &lt;label&gt; &lt;newlabel&gt; &lt;flux1&gt; &lt;flux2&gt;
<dd>Splits the specified flux concentrations into two different concentrations
that are colocated.  Should probably be followed by MOVE lines for the two
separate "child" concentrations.

<p><dt><code><b>J[OIN]</b> &lt;label1&gt; &lt;label2&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;z&gt; [&lt;flux&gt;]
<dd>Joins the two flux concentrations into one that has the same 
label as the first one, is located at the specified coordinates, and
has the specified flux (if specified). 

<p><dt><code><b>E[MERGE]</b> &lt;label1&gt; &lt;label2&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;z&gt; &lt;x1&gt; &lt;y1&gt; &lt;z1&gt; &lt;flux&gt;
<dd>Produces two opposite polarity flux concentrations at
(x,y,z) and (x1,y1,z1).  The first one has the specified flux; the second one has the opposite
value.  This is different than two N(ew) operations because it implies that the
two flux concentrations are connected and should be treated differently by the
field line modeler than two simple additions.

<p><dt><code><b>C[ANCEL]</b> &lt;label1&gt; &lt;label2&gt;
<dd>The named flux concentrations are both deleted.  They should have 
roughly opposing flux values.  This is different than two DELETE lines because
it implies that the two concenctrations are cancelling and should be treated
differently by the field line modeler than two simple deletions.

<p><dt><code><b>L[INE]</b> &lt;label1&gt; &lt;label2&gt; &lt;FL_label&gt; &lt;flux&gt;
<dd>A field line is created between flux concentrations &lt;label1&gt; and &lt;label2&gt;, carrying &lt;flux&gt; units of magnetic flux.  The concentrations
must exist, and the field line's label &lt;FL_label&gt; must be unique in the
file.  The flux concentrations must have opposite sign, and the field line is
rearranges so that (A) it always has positive flux, and (B) it always goes
(as you might expect) from the positive flux concentration to the negative one.

<p><dt><code><b>V[ERTEX]</b> &lt;FL_lab&gt; &lt;pos&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;z&gt;
<dd>A vertex is added to the specified field line, at the position indicated. 
For practical purposes, position counting starts at 1.  Negative positions
count backwards from the end of the fieldline.  To add to the beginning
of the fieldline, use position 1.  To add to the end of the fieldline, use
either a huge position or -2.  The positions 0 and -1 refer to the endpoints
of the fieldline, which are anchored to the flux concentration.  Access
to them is left in the I/O space for completeness, but you probably shouldn't
be messing with them.

<p><dt><code><b>FRAME</b> &lt;Frame_no&gt;
<dd>A new timestep begins here.  The tracker uses this as a check that the
frame numbers are still synched.

<p><dt><code><b>FINISHED</b>
<dd>The timestep ends here.  The tracker sends this when it's done
sending all the data from a particular frame; the simulator uses this as
a cue to run its physics before reading more data.

The file describes four flux concentrations which appear in Frame 0
and move in Frame 1, and two concentrations (labels 6 and 7) which
emerge in Frame 1.  Concentration 6 has +22x10<sup>19</sup> Mx, and 7 has 
-22x10<sup>19</sup> Mx.
