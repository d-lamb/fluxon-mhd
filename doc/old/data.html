<h2>FLEM modules: data.c</h2>

<dl>
<p><dt><code>barf</code>, <code>init_barf</code>
<dd>Primitive exit handling.  Not used much -- most stuff just exits if it has to.
That's probably a bug.

<p><dt><code>new_label</code>, <code>new_vertex_label</code>
<dd>Code to generate new unique identifiers for fluxons and vertices.  The identifiers
are integers and uniqueness is only guaranteed across a single save file:  as each
new vertex or fluxon number is encountered, a cached largest-value is incremented.  
The numbers are longs, so there are plenty.  

<p><dt><code>new_fluxon</code>, <code>new_vertex</code>, <code>new_flux_concentration</code>, <code>new_world</code>
<dd>Generators for the principal data structures.  Each one returns the appropriate type
of flux concentration, stuffed with parameters taken from the parameter list.

<p><dt><code>spawn_new_vertex</code>
<dd>Generator and linker for new vertices:  spawns the new vertex and links it in with
the neighbor lists and linear geometry of another, already-existing vertex.

<p><dt><code>unlink_vertex</code>, <code>add_vertex_pos</code>, <code>add_vertex_after</code>
<dd>Vertex linked-list handlers.  Fluxons are, at heart, linked lists of vertices.

<p><dt><code>clear_links</code>, <code>tree_top</code>, <code>tree_walk</code>, <code>tree_find</code>, <code>tree_insert</code>, <code>tree_balance_check</code>, <code>tree_unlink</code>, <code>tree_balance</code>, <code>world_state_name</code>
<dd><h4>Tree routines</h4>

<p>Generified Tree handlers -- deal with the tree structures that are used for so many
of our data structures.

<p>Since there are several trees and they need to be threaded in different ways, 
the tree infrastructure is separate than the data structures themselves:  FLUXONs, 
flux concentraitons, etc. are all linked into a couple of trees that thread through
each datum.  So you have to feed some ancillary integers to each of the routines, pointing
to where in the target structure the tree information lives!  You also end up having
to do a lot of explicit casting -- the variables are all void * in here.

<p><dt><code>new_dumblist</code>, <code>free_dumblist</code>, <code>dumblist_quickadd</code>, <code>dumblist_add</code>, <code>dumblist_delete</code>, <code>dumblist_rm</code>, <code>dumblist_grow</code>, <code>dumblist_qsort</code>, <code>dumblist_sort</code>, <code>dumblist_snarf</code>, <code>dumblist_clear</code>
<dd><h4>Dumblist routines</h4>

<p>  Dumblists are just generic list structures -- they're smart, dynamically allocated arrays.  Each dumblist grows to its high water mark and stays fully allocated until you blow the whole thing away.  They're designed as a compromise
data structure for the numerous small lists of things that we end up dealing with.  
Because they're generic, you end up doing a lot of casting of (VOID *)'s  

<p>Most of the routines are pretty obvious.  Some catches:  <code>dumblist_rm</code> deletes a single item, whose position is known, from a dumblist.  <code>dumblist_delete</code> 
deletes all instances of a particular item, whose position is not known, from a dumblist.
<code>dumblist_qsort</code> is the recursive engine for <code>dumblist_sort</code>.
