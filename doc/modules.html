<h2>FLEM Modules</h2>

<p>(Each module has a <code>foo.h</code> header file and a <code>foo.c</code>
program file...)

<p><dd><b>data</b>
<dt>Contains primitive operations on field lines and vertices.

<p><dd><b>concentrations</b>
<dt>Primitive operations on flux concentrations.

<p><dd><b>io</b>
<dt>Routines for reading and writing data -- both field line and 
flux concentration stuff.

<p><dd><b>geometry</b>
<dt>Primitive geometric operations -- dot product, rotation, &amp;c.

<p><dd><b>model</b>
<dt>Somewhat higher-order geometric functions and model-dependent calculations,
such as neighbor-finding and winnowing code.

<p><dd><b>physics</b>
<dt>Physics operations such as force calculations for fluxels with their
neighbors already defined.
