21-Oct-2005: v. 1.1 updates:
	- Changes to the way that step scaling is controlled.  You can now set the
		power to which various parameters are raised to find the scaling factor
		at each node.
	- Perl interface has been updated: the principal structures all exist as tied hashes.
	  You can read (but not write) dumblists as perl lists.  All scalar and vector	
	  quantities are r/w.  For example,
		$a = read_world('pdl/menagerie/potential.flux');
		print $a->fluxon(200)->vertex(2)->{x};
			[-0.936 0.02 0.289]
