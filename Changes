31-May-2006:
	- Added rudimentary version information -- in $FLUX::file_versions.  It tells you the location, mod date, and size of each source file in the FLUX library.
	- clamped output step to minimum neighbor distance.
29-May-2006:
	- Clamped output step -- no vertex can move more than the distance to its nearest neighbor on the same fluxon.  This is to avoid some of the weirder anomalies from ds step scaling, but probably needs to use *all* neighbors rather than just fluxon buddies.
23-May-2006: 
	- Added a new force law -- f_pressure_equi2 -- that allows correct calculation without resorting to the kludge of running f_pressure_equi twice.
	- Fixed vertex deallocation (was a bug in dumblist_delete).
	- lots of updates in early 2006 - notably a tied-hash front end for
	  parameters on the perl side.  Painful but worth it.


21-Oct-2005: v. 1.1 updates:
	- Changes to the way that step scaling is controlled.  You can now set the
		power to which various parameters are raised to find the scaling factor
		at each node.
	- Perl interface has been updated: the principal structures all exist as tied hashes.
	  You can read (but not write) dumblists as perl lists.  All scalar and vector	
	  quantities are r/w.  For example,
		$a = read_world('pdl/menagerie/potential.flux');
		print $a->fluxon(200)->vertex(2)->{x};
			[-0.936 0.02 0.289]
