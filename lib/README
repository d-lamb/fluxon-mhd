This is the C module portion of FLUX, the Field Line Universal
relaXer.  The '.c' files are copied with 'subst_filename' to
'<foo>.cf.c', to preserve the current time & date in the compiled
code.  The modules themselves compile to a library, 'libflux.a', 
which can be installed into /usr/local/lib.
