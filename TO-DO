Memory scrozzling in the perl interface.

Problems with the newer magnetic & force calculations... (old ones work OK)

Finish adding pressure law.

Think about line-pressure vs. force on vertex...

Problems with ultralarge forces (ultrasmall distances) in the last fluxel...
	 noticed infinite regression in fix_proximity because of this,
	 but that was a symptom of some sort of proximity problem.

- asymmetry in potential relaxation with older laws (180 degree rotation; 
problem with projection?)

	- (test with simple-9 -- reproduces OK)
	- (simple-4: no problem)
	- (simple-5: no problem)
	(requires nontrivial geometry....)

	- simple-8: immediate problem; blows up on the z axis.  Sounds like
	an angular fencepost error -- either in the Voronoi code or the force
	law.

	- Problem is with newer hull code, which seems to screw up nontrivial
	  configurations.  Use 'draw_hull' and simple-8.flux to see.
	- Hmmm... Seems not to be due to the hull code but rather to the projection
	  code.  Use 'proj_neighbors' to identify (missing some additional vertices
	  in some cases)

	- Hmmm.. fl_segment_deluxe_dist is giving trouble.
	- Actually, it's ls_closest_approach.

11-August-2005
	- Okay, ls_closest_approach is working now (I think).  Hull seems screwed up?
	- installed hull diagnoser on perl side; hulls look OK.  Checking against
	   simple-8 case (which looked funny the other day).
	- Hull looks OK but placement of vertices appears quite inconsistent.  Consider e.g.
          Vertex 13 in simple_8, projected into Vertex 14's perp. plane.  Sometimes it is located at (0,437) or
	  thereabouts; sometimes it is located at (0.02) or thereabouts.

	Close of day: found bug in ls_closest_approach; that fixed the heisenbug 
	(vector was being loaded into 'c' rather than 'd') but induced other 
	problems with test_hull.  Why do the two plots not agree?

12-August-2005
	- Problem is discrepancies between the output of Vertex::hull (in Vertex.xs - used by 
	  plot_hull in Vertex.pm) and direct hulling of the projected output of proj_neighbors.
	  Hmmm... That is a problem with vertex_update_neighbors, which is called directly from
	  hull() in Vertex.xs.  
		-Could it be that the buffer is getting overwritten? 
		-No.  data from hull_verts is pulled out before any other flux calls.
		-Something is wrong with dumblist sorting.  winnow_cmp_1 is the comparison routine and its
	  	 output doesn't make sense.  Things are being sorted OK but not culled.
	        -That wasn't it.  The culling was a problem in dumblist_crunch; that's fixed but the problem
		 persists.  Time to head out -- this won't get fixed today.


16-Aug-2005
	hull_test works OK now.
	run test_freeze.pdl -- freezes.  Why?

	"$a=read_world(menagerie/potential.flux); $a->update_neighbors(1)":
	this causes a bus error. Why?
