Memory scrozzling in the perl interface.

Problems with the newer magnetic & force calculations... (old ones work OK)

Finish adding pressure law.

Think about line-pressure vs. force on vertex...

Problems with ultralarge forces (ultrasmall distances) in the last fluxel...
	 noticed infinite regression in fix_proximity because of this,
	 but that was a symptom of some sort of proximity problem.

- asymmetry in potential relaxation with older laws (180 degree rotation; 
problem with projection?)

	- (test with simple-9 -- reproduces OK)
	- (simple-4: no problem)
	- (simple-5: no problem)
	(requires nontrivial geometry....)

	- simple-8: immediate problem; blows up on the z axis.  Sounds like
	an angular fencepost error -- either in the Voronoi code or the force
	law.

	- Problem is with newer hull code, which seems to screw up nontrivial
	  configurations.  Use 'draw_hull' and simple-8.flux to see.
	- Hmmm... Seems not to be due to the hull code but rather to the projection
	  code.  Use 'proj_neighbors' to identify (missing some additional vertices
	  in some cases)
