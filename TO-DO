Memory scrozzling in the perl interface.

Problems with the newer magnetic & force calculations... (old ones work OK)

Finish adding pressure law.

Think about line-pressure vs. force on vertex...

Problems with ultralarge forces (ultrasmall distances) in the last fluxel...
	 noticed infinite regression in fix_proximity because of this,
	 but that was a symptom of some sort of proximity problem.

Okay, looks like most everything was resolved last week, but I better
put some notes in here.  Relaxation seems to at least work for all
force laws now, though the non-normalized forces are out of whack.
(the normalized forces seem OK)

I added disco-cylinder boundary conditions -- but a more general boundary
is going to be necessary. 


	- general boundary conditions
	- figure out why non-normalized forces aren't relaxing right
